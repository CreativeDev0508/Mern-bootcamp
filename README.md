# Complete Free Coding Bootcamp 2020 MERN Stack (For Beginners) 

This is a series video were we going to build a full-stack application from scratch using the MERN STACK ( MongoDB, Express, React.js and Nodejs).

We will build a <strong>Sports App</strong> for creating sports events and the app will include:

* User registration and authentication (maybe add facebook/gmail login if series becomes popular)
* Hashing password for security 
* Authentication 
* Session control (user will see specific content)
* CRUD operations
* Search for events using filters (Running, Cycling or Swimming) 
* Sign UP for event in order to participate
* Upload images to the server
* Website notification using web sockets (sockets.io) 

### Milestones of the project
<strong>And if the series get more than 1000 likes in the first video I will create a React-Native app for it!</strong>
<strong>And if the series get more than 5000 likes in the first video I will add social media functionality such as user profile</strong>

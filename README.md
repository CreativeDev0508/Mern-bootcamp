# Complete Free Coding Bootcamp 2020 - the MERN Stack (For Beginners) 

This is a series video were we going to build a full-stack application from scratch using the MERN STACK ( MongoDB, Express, React.js and Nodejs).

We will build a <strong>Sports Web App</strong> for creating sports events and the app will include:

* User registration and authentication (maybe add facebook/gmail login if the series becomes popular) 
* Hashing password for security 
* Session control
* CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete) 
* Search for events using filters (Running, Cycling or Swimming) 
* Sign UP for event in order to participate
* Upload images to the server
* Website notification using web sockets (in order to approve or refuse the Event Sign UP request) 

### Milestones of the project

Series get more than <strong>1000 Stars </strong> I will create a <strong>React-Native</strong> APP for it!<br />

## Deploying your webapp

For deploying this project we will modificate our backend and start using the S3 data storage from AWS.
Heroku does not keep your files into the server and because of that we are moving away from saving the images in disk to saving the images into the S3 that will host the images for us.
You will need to create an AWS account and a new bucket that will be explained into the Episode 13-A.
Following the next episode 13-B we are spliting the Backend and Frontend into two separeted projects to take the advantage of Heroku's CI/CD that basicly deploy your code automatically when detects a new code into your github repository.
